    "# Parsing webpages with a Large Language Model (LLM) revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "[I previously wrote about parsing websites and extract structured data](https://hdembinski.github.io/posts/parsing_webpages_with_llm.html), but that was in January 2025 and a lot has happened in the LLM sphere since then. The pace at which development moves forward is truly mind-boggling. Since then, I changed my mind about a couple of things, especially regarding the libraries that I would recommend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### llama.cpp > ollama\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't praise `ollama` anymore, instead I'll recommend running [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). `ollama` is great to get a head start into the world of LLMs, because it makes installing and running your first LLM really easy, but the team behind it has shown behavior that raises red flags.\n",
    "* The project is essentially wrapping [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp), but for a long time did not provide proper attribution, see [ollama-3697](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/3697). Even now you need to scroll down the whole README to find out that attribution, which seems unfair as all the hard engineering work to make LLMs run fast on consumer hardware is done by the `llama.cpp` team.\n",
    "* They introduced their own format for storing LLMs, which is incompatible with the standard GGUF format, meaning that you cannot easily switch to other tools to run the same models that you already downloaded.\n",
    "* The performance is worse compared to `llama.cpp` compiled from sources (see the benchmark section).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PydanticAI > llama-index\n",
    "\n",
    "[In my post about RAG](https://hdembinski.github.io/posts/llama_index_rag.html), I advertised `llama-index`, which was based on a survey of several AI libraries. I have since discovered [PydanticAI](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai), which is from the same team that brought us the fantastic [Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic). Both libraries abstract away annoying details and boilerplate, while giving you layers of control from high-level down to the fundamentals, if you need it (and in the realm of LLMs, you often need to dig in deep). Most libraries only achieve the former, but fail at the latter. They also have excellent documentation. `PydanticAI` is great for extracting structured output, so we will use it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The task\n",
    "\n",
    "With that out of the way, let's revisit the task. In this post, I will let the LLM parse a web page to extract data and return it in a structured format. More specifically, I will read a couple of web pages from InspireHEP about a few scientific papers on which I am a co-author and then extract lists of references contained in these pages. Normally, one would write a parser to solve this task, but with LLMs we can skip that and just describe the task in human language. With the advent of strong coding models, there is also an interesting third option, the hybrid approach, where we let LLM write the grammar for a parser based on a bunch of example documents. The hybrid approach is arguably the best one if the structure of the source documents changes only rarely, because it provides deterministic outcomes and is much more energy efficient than using a LLM. LLMs are great for one-shot or few-shot tasks, where writing a parser would not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer:* I'll note again that there are easier ways to solve this particular task: InspireHEP allows one to download information about papers in machine readable format (BibTeX and others). The point of this post is to show how to do it with an LLM, because that approach can also be used for other pages that do not offer access to their data in machine-readable format."

    "202120222023202432Abstract: (SISSA)The deficit of muons in the simulation of extensive air showers is a long-standing problem and the origin of large uncertainties in the reconstruction of the mass of the high energy primary cosmic rays. Hadronic interaction models, re-tuned after early LHC data, have a more consistent description of the muon content among them but still disagree with data. Collective hadronization due to the formation of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) has already been studied as a possible cause for a larger production of muons under extreme conditions (rare, very central nuclear interactions), but without real success. However, in the view of the most recent LHC data, a collective hadronization phase might not only be limited to such extreme conditions. And because of its different ratio of electromagnetic to hadronic energy, a QGP may have the properties to solve the muon puzzle. This hypothesis is demonstrated using a theoretical approach and tested in a proper way by the modification of hadronic model spectra in CONEX to mimic the production of a QGP also in less extreme conditions with a possible large impact on air shower physics.\n",

    "\n",
    "The output is pretty good for such a small model, also considering the modest quality of the input. The LLM correctly identified the relevant pieces: authors, journal information, and the paper title. Which is which is not really obvious from the raw input, the pieces are not clearly labelled. The model uses its knowledge how a name looks like, how a journal reference looks like and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should note, however, that the output quality varies considerably from run to run, and to get to this quality, several iterations on the prompt were necessary. Reducing the temperature for the model to make it 'less creative' seemed to have a positive effect. In a professional context, one would need to find the optimum prompt and temperature by running the model on a large number of test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mistake analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model ignored the instruction to shorten long author lists, but larger models are able to do that. While the model was able to count authors in isolation, it fails to comprehend rules such as \"shorten the author list if it contains more than X names\". It will even claim nonsense like that \"three names are more than four\".\n",
    "- The model failed to convert the LaTeX in the title of the first paper correctly, `$\\sqrt{s} = ...$` just became `s = ...`, while it should be `sqrt(s) = ...`.\n",
    "- The model rarely makes spelling mistakes when text is copied verbatim. It rather makes higher-level mistakes, like omitting an author completely, than misspelling them. Spelling mistakes do occur, however, see e.g. case 1.1, where \"Johanes\" is misspelled.\n",
    "- The last reference is special, this is an unpublished preprint. It does not have a DOI, for example. The model nevertheless produced a reasonable entry sometimes, but in other cases it hallucinates DOIs that do not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Failed attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "One technique to improve the output of a flawed model is to let the model critique its previous output and suggest improvements. I tried this, but this small model is unable to critique itself, it always accepts its own answer even if it does not adhere to the requested format."

    "[DeepSeek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948) is a new Open Source reasoning model which uses test-time compute to improve its reasoning, like OpenAI's o1 model. Basically, it has the chain-of-thought prompting technique hard-wired and will generate a thinking process before answering. In several benchmarks it reaches the same performance as o1.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the full DeepSeek-R1 model with over 600b parameters is too large to be run locally, the authors provide distilled smaller models. I use one of these based on Llama-3.1 with 8b parameters, the same architecture that `llama3-chatqa` uses. I also tried another version based on Qwen2 with 14b parameters, but it is consistently crashing the Ollama server after a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the output of this model for our task, we need to skip over the thinking process and keep only the final output. That is easy to do, because the model is trained to always put its thinking in `<think>` tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the model to be smarter in following our requirements, especially the rule about shortening long lists of authors, which requires reasoning."

    "The model is indeed better at counting the authors and appropriately replacing long author lists with the \"et al.\" form. It even managed once to follow the instruction to convert LaTeX code into a proper text description by replacing `\\sqrt{s}` with `√s`, which is impressive. Overall, the output is more consistent than with `llama3-chatqa`, but the model still makes a few minor and major mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It occasionally produces an invalid URL, omitting the `https:` prefix. `llama3-chatqa` never makes that mistake.\n",
    "- It does not always follow the instruction to remove all emphasis markup from the reference. That can be rectified by post-processing in this case.\n",
    "- In one case, it swapped the order of title and journal.\n",
    "- Similar to `llama3-chatqa`, it usually hallucinates an invalid journal and DOI for the last paper, because it was only released on arXiv, but occasionally it got it right, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the distilled `deepseek-r1` model performs slightly better at this task, although it is using the same architecture as `llama3-chatqa`, at the cost of using 6x more compute. It would be interesting to see whether a version that is less quantized performs better, in which case the errors could be attributed to \"noise\" in the reasoning process, or whether the main issue is the limited attention capability of 8b models, which have fewer attention blocks compared to larger models."
