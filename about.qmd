I did a PhD in astroparticle physics at RWTH Aachen and had several postdocs positions in at KIT Karlsruhe, the University of Delaware, Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics, and TU Dortmund University. I have curious mind and a broad range of interests, professionally they circle around data analysis, statistics, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I am a member of the [Boost C++ Project](www.boost.org), to which I contributed the Histogram library. My C++ skill is in the grandmaster area, but recently I only program in Python, since it is so much more enjoyable and with [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) one can write numerical code in Python with performance on par with C++ in a fraction of the time.
